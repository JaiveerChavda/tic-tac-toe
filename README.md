# Real-Time Crosses and Noughts Game

## Description

This is a real-time crosses and noughts game built with Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js, inspired by the Laracasts course ["Real Time Game with Laravel"](https://laracasts.com/series/real-time-games-with-laravel).  The game allows players to create a new game, join existing games, and compete against each other. When a player wins, a modal popup is displayed to announce the winner. 

This project is a perfect showcasing of [Reverb](https://reverb.laravel.com/) and [Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo), two powerfull tool for real time broadcasting.

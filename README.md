# Play Tic Tac Toe - Built Using Laravel Reverb

## Description

This is tic tac toe game built with Laravel, Vue.js, and Inertia.js, inspired by the Laracasts course ["Real Time Game with Laravel"](https://laracasts.com/series/real-time-games-with-laravel).  The game allows a player to create a new game, join existing games, and compete against each other in real time. 

This project is a perfect showcasing of [Reverb](https://reverb.laravel.com/) (web-socket server) and [Echo](https://github.com/laravel/echo) (library for listening, event broadcasted by backend server), two powerfull tools mainly used for live-updating user-interfaces. 
If you're begineer and want to learn how modern web-applications update things in real-time then, follow this projects commit step by step to learn every single feature.I tried to Version Control every small thing.
